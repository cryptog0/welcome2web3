## TLDR
Web 3.0 is being advertised as the next phase of the internet which is built on Blockchain technology. Welcome2Web3 showcases what social media would look like if it were built on Web 3.0. It is designed to highlight that users will have to pay for every social interaction, whether it is liking, commenting, posting, etc, and that all user data will be publicly available.

## Why?
I have recently been bombarded with advertisements, promoted content and questions from colleagues regarding NFT's and Web 3.0. I have worked as a web based software developer for almost a decade and had no idea what Web 3.0 meant. When I attempted to learn about it, I was met with what I would later realise was lots of misinformation and ignorance. After researching the Web 3.0 code base, I was able to understand how applications built using Web 3.0 would work. Instead of attempting to explain my findings, I created this website.

## What is Web 3.0
A typical Social Media website consists of two components, the front-end and the back-end. The front-end refers to the content you see when you visit a website, it's layout and how you can interact with it. The back-end refers to the computers which are responsible for processing and storing your data. For example, when you post a comment, it is sent from your computer to the back-end where it is stored within a database. The back-end is owned and controlled by the Social Media company, your data can be stored on one computer, or thousands, depending on the scale of the company. To Web 3.0 enthusiasts, this is referred to as a Centralized service.

Allowing companies to store and control our data can be problematic and Web 3.0 has been proposed in an attempt to solve those problems. The general idea behind Web 3.0 is to store user's data within a network that is not owned by an individual company. Instead, a large number of independent computers process and store data, this is referred as a Decentralized service.

There are a few catches which challenge the decentralization proposed by Web 3.0:
- A web application is still owned and controlled by an individual company,
- The underlying code for any application is centralized,
- Storing data on a Blockchain can be very expensive so centralized data storage services are commonly used.

Web 3.0 does not have to be associated to a crypto currency or Blockchain technology. However, it is most commonly used to referrence websites that interact with the Ethereum Blockchain. In this case a Web 3.0 website works in the same way that websites work today (with a front and back-end), however, the back-end involves storing or accessing information from the Ethereum Blockchain.

## Social Media on Web 3.0
The Social Media application Welcome2Web3 emulates works on the Ethereum Blockchain. Every time you like or comment on an image, your action needs to be stored in a database somewhere. Normally, you don't have to pay to like or post because the Social Media companies pay for this. However, using Web 3.0 you need to pay for your actions to be stored within the computers on the Ethereum Blockchain. The cost of storing information on the Blockchain is referred to as GAS and at the time of writting costs roughly $2 USD per 1kb of data. To put this into perspective, a high resolution photograph can be upwards of 4000kb, or $8,000.


## Will Web 3.0 Always Cost?
The concept of Web 3.0 is still in the very early days. It most commonly refers to the applications built on the Ethereum Blockchain where Web 3.0 applications will always cost if they involve writing data. However, there are other frameworks which are being developed under the Web 3.0 label which will not require users to pay. Instead, these frameworks typically expect users to participate in storing eachothers data, which poses it's own set of risks and challenges.
